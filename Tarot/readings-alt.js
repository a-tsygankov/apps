window.TAROT_READINGS_ALT = {

  'The Fool': {
    upright: 'Congratulations — you have been selected to walk off a perfectly good cliff in pursuit of something the universe described as "an adventure." The dog barking at your heels is not trying to stop you; it is trying to tell you that you forgot your wallet. But here is the thing: the Fool has the highest success rate of anyone who has ever started. Ignorance of all the reasons something cannot be done is, it turns out, a remarkable advantage. Leap. The parachute assembles on the way down.',
    reversed: 'Either you have been standing at the edge of that cliff so long that the dog went home, or you leapt without even glancing at the terrain below, which technically counts as enthusiasm. The Fool reversed suggests a failure to launch or a launch conducted entirely without instruments. Both are fixable. One requires courage. The other requires, minimally, a map.'
  },

  'The Magician': {
    upright: 'You have everything you need. The wand, the cup, the sword, the coin — all laid out on your table. Now you are just standing there refreshing your email. The Magician is the card of genuine power and capability, which makes it slightly embarrassing when it shows up to remind you that you have been treating your extraordinary potential as a hobby. Pick up the wand. Not metaphorically. Pick it up.',
    reversed: 'The Magician reversed is either a con artist or someone who has been preparing to start for approximately one geological era. If the tools are all there and nothing is happening, the variable is you. There may also be actual deception at play — someone who performs capability very convincingly while producing nothing. This card reversed asks you to consider which of those descriptions applies, and to be honest about it.'
  },

  'The High Priestess': {
    upright: 'She is sitting between two pillars, holding a scroll, and she is not telling you what is on it. This is extremely on-brand for The High Priestess, who communicates exclusively through feelings, dreams, and the unsettling sensation that you already know the answer to the question you are asking. You do. Stop Googling it. Stop asking people. Stop making pros and cons lists. Sit quietly for five minutes and listen to what arrives. It will be correct.',
    reversed: 'The inner voice is there. You have simply been drowning it out with podcasts, group chats, unsolicited opinions, and an impressive commitment to avoiding the one quiet moment that would tell you everything. The reversed High Priestess does not judge you for this. She simply points, silently, at your own chest. The scroll is in there. You have had it the whole time.'
  },

  'The Empress': {
    upright: 'The Empress is reclining in a field of wheat, surrounded by abundance, and she would like you to know that you are allowed to enjoy your life. This is not a trap. She is not about to take it away. The universe is not holding a surprise invoice for your happiness. You have been treating pleasure and rest as things you must earn and then feel guilty about, and the Empress finds this genuinely puzzling. Receive. Flourish. It is not a personality flaw.',
    reversed: 'Either you are nurturing everyone in your vicinity to the point of personal depletion, or the well is dry and creativity has been replaced by a persistent beige feeling. The Empress reversed is the card of the burned-out caretaker and the blocked artist in equal measure. Both need the same thing: to be given back to before they can give. The solution is embarrassingly simple and astonishingly hard to implement. Rest.'
  },

  'The Emperor': {
    upright: 'Here sits the Emperor: structured, decisive, in possession of excellent posture and an opinion about everything. This card is asking you to stop improvising and build something that will still be standing next Thursday. Discipline, systems, clear expectations — not the most glamorous prescription, but the one that works. The Emperor did not conquer anything by waiting to feel motivated. He built a routine and then the empire, in that order.',
    reversed: 'The Emperor reversed is either an authoritarian who has confused his preferences with universal law, or someone who genuinely cannot operate without seventeen overlapping systems and still misses deadlines. If you recognize yourself: the map is not the territory, and the spreadsheet is not the work. Alternatively, if someone in your life fits the reversed Emperor profile, please know that "because I said so" is not, technically, a strategy.'
  },

  'The Hierophant': {
    upright: 'The Hierophant arrives in full regalia to remind you that some wisdom is actually just old, and old is not the same as wrong. Tradition, mentorship, and accumulated knowledge from people who made the mistakes before you did — these have genuine value, even when they arrive with unnecessarily complicated hats. You do not have to reinvent every wheel. Some wheels are fine. Learn from the institution before you decide whether to burn it down.',
    reversed: 'The institution has clearly failed to justify the hat. The Hierophant reversed appears when the rules have become the point rather than the means to a point, and when someone is defending a tradition with more energy than the tradition deserves. Question everything — especially the things that respond to questions with "because that is how it has always been done," which is not an answer; it is a filing system error.'
  },

  'The Lovers': {
    upright: 'The Lovers card is commonly mistaken for being about romance. It is actually about a choice that requires you to be completely honest about what you value — and then to choose accordingly, even when both options look appealing from a safe distance. The garden looks very nice. The person is right there. At some point, the fruit gets eaten and everything becomes more complicated and more real. Choose from your whole self. The fig leaf approach has limited utility.',
    reversed: 'Something is misaligned: a relationship in which both people are performing a version of themselves that neither actually is, or a choice being avoided because both options seem to involve some kind of loss, which is accurate, and also unavoidable. You are not being asked to find the option with no cost. You are being asked to be honest about which cost you are actually willing to pay.'
  },

  'The Chariot': {
    upright: 'You are harnessing two sphinxes of opposite temperament and asking them to pull in the same direction, which sounds like a management challenge because it is. The Chariot is the card of winning through sheer determined coordination of your own contradictions. You contain multitudes. Those multitudes can either argue or drive. Victory belongs to the person who makes them drive. Hold the reins. Lean forward. Pick a direction that is actually forward.',
    reversed: 'The sphinxes have staged a coup. One wants to go left, one wants to go right, and the chariot is describing increasingly dramatic circles while the driver maintains an expression of confident authority. Something has gone sideways — either aggression deployed without direction, or direction attempted without adequate force. Either way, stop for a moment. Check where you are actually going. That turns out to matter.'
  },

  'Strength': {
    upright: 'The traditional image of this card shows a person closing a lion\'s mouth with their bare hands while looking completely serene — which is either the most impressive thing imaginable or a very bad dental plan. The point is that the lion is not being beaten; it is being loved into cooperation. Whatever large, inconvenient, slightly terrifying thing you are dealing with right now: force will not work. Patience, presence, and an unreasonable amount of gentle determination will.',
    reversed: 'The lion is currently winning, and you are either being dragged around by it or have locked it in a room and thrown away the key, which will not end well for the room. Strength reversed is the card of the impulse that took the wheel, or the impulse so thoroughly suppressed it has started chewing through the walls. Both situations call for the same response: show up to the difficult thing with more gentleness than seems warranted.'
  },

  'The Hermit': {
    upright: 'The Hermit has walked away from all of it — the opinions, the noise, the group project energy — and gone up a mountain with a lantern that only lights the next three feet of path. This turns out to be enough. Wisdom is not found by polling your social circle. Some questions only have one source of valid input, and that source is the silence inside you that you have been scheduling around. The mountain will still be there after the meeting. So will the answer.',
    reversed: 'Either the Hermit has been on the mountain so long he has forgotten what human faces look like, which is a different kind of problem, or he came down prematurely and is now surrounded by people and noise and deeply regretting leaving. The reversed Hermit is also the person filling every available second with stimulus to avoid the one thing the quiet would say. The silence knows. The silence has always known. Make an appointment with it.'
  },

  'Wheel of Fortune': {
    upright: 'Cosmic wheel is spinning! Nobody asked it to. It does not care. The Wheel of Fortune is the tarot\'s way of explaining that sometimes things change not because of anything you did, but because that is what things do. The good news is that this applies equally when things are going badly. The less reassuring news is that it also applies when they are going well. Your job is to remain approximately upright and avoid confusing your current position on the wheel with your permanent address.',
    reversed: 'The wheel has either stalled in an inconvenient position or is spinning in what appears to be the wrong direction, and you are now asking the universe to please explain itself. It will not. The reversed Wheel of Fortune is simply the long version of "not yet." Frustrating? Yes. A permanent condition? No. Work with what is actually in front of you while the mechanism does whatever the mechanism is doing.'
  },

  'Justice': {
    upright: 'Justice appears with scales and a sword and absolutely no interest in your excuses. She has heard them all. She finds them charming in the way that one finds a child\'s explanation for a broken window charming — entertaining but ultimately beside the point. The scales are measuring not intent but action, not potential but reality. The good news is that the same principle applies in your favor: your actual efforts will be weighed fairly. The universe is not looking for reasons to punish you. It is just keeping accurate books.',
    reversed: 'Something has been judged unfairly — either a situation that has not resolved as it should, or a habit of self-prosecution so aggressive that you are serving a sentence for crimes you did not commit, or crimes you have already served. Justice reversed also covers the person who is so committed to being wronged that they have begun manufacturing injustices to maintain the narrative. None of this is useful. What does balance actually look like here?'
  },

  'The Hanged Man': {
    upright: 'The Hanged Man is suspended upside down from a tree by one ankle, and his expression is one of serene enlightenment. This is either the most advanced spiritual attainment imaginable or a spectacularly effective cognitive reframe. Either way: he got to this perspective by stopping, by giving up control, and by looking at everything from the angle he previously never considered. Your pause is not wasted time. It is the most productive thing you are not doing.',
    reversed: 'At some point, hanging upside down from a tree stops being a spiritual practice and starts being a circulation problem. The reversed Hanged Man suggests that the waiting has run its course — you have received whatever the suspension was offering, or you have been avoiding something under the cover of patience, which is a different thing. Come down from the tree. The world would like to know what you learned up there.'
  },

  'Death': {
    upright: 'Death arrives on a white horse, carrying a banner, looking extremely committed to his appointment, and everyone in the card is in various stages of not being ready. This is very relatable. Nobody is ever ready. But here is what Death does not do, technically: it does not end you. It ends the version of you that cannot cross the threshold into whatever comes next. Something must close for something else to open. The door is right there. The horse is very patient.',
    reversed: 'Change is being resisted with a dedication that, in any other context, would be admirable. The thing that needs to end is being kept alive through sheer force of attachment — like holding a funeral and then quietly moving the person back in. The reversed Death card is the universe gently pointing out that the expiration date on this particular chapter passed some time ago. The sooner you acknowledge it, the sooner the new story can introduce its opening sentence.'
  },

  'Temperance': {
    upright: 'An angel is standing with one foot in water and one on land, pouring liquid between two cups with an expression of absolute compositional tranquility. This is the card of moderation — which sounds boring until you realize that most catastrophes are caused by the failure to achieve exactly this. Not too much. Not too little. Pour with care. Combine what seemed incompatible. The angel is not playing it safe; the angel is playing the most difficult game available, which is doing exactly the right amount of everything at precisely the right moment.',
    reversed: 'Something is wildly out of proportion, and you know which thing. The reversed Temperance card does not even need to specify because it is almost certainly the thing you thought of first. Excess, imbalance, extremity — in consumption, in emotion, in effort, in avoidance. The prescription is not to go to the opposite extreme, which would just be a different imbalance with better PR. The prescription is the much harder thing: the middle. Start there.'
  },

  'The Devil': {
    upright: 'Two figures stand chained to a pedestal beneath a creature with bat wings and an inverted pentagram, and if you look closely, the chains are loose enough to remove. This has always been the joke. The chains are loose. They have always been loose. The Devil\'s entire business model depends on you not checking the chains. Whatever has a hold on you — the habit, the relationship, the story about yourself, the subscription you forgot to cancel — check the chains. They are probably looser than they look.',
    reversed: 'The reversed Devil is either the chains coming off — which is genuinely excellent news — or the chains coming off and the person running immediately toward a different set of chains, which is less excellent but very human. Shadow work is underway. Something is being examined that has not been examined before. The trap is becoming visible. That is the first and most necessary step. Do not celebrate by immediately finding a new trap. Give yourself a moment.'
  },

  'The Tower': {
    upright: 'Lightning has struck a tower. The crown is flying off. Two figures are falling out of the windows, and they look surprised, which is the most relatable thing about this card. The Tower is what happens when the universe decides that your carefully constructed false foundation cannot stand one more minute and takes direct action. The good news is that towers built on actual ground do not fall. The better news is that you now have excellent building materials and a very clear picture of what did not work. This is genuinely useful information.',
    reversed: 'The tower is swaying but has not yet fallen, which is either a stay of execution or a warning shot, depending on how much genuine structural work you do in the interval. The reversed Tower can also mean a collapse that happened slowly — not the lightning strike but the months of quietly ignored cracks. Either way, the building is having an opinion about its own foundations. It would be worthwhile to listen before it schedules a second opinion.'
  },

  'The Star': {
    upright: 'After The Tower, after all of that, the Star appears — and she is kneeling by water under an enormous sky full of stars, pouring hope back into the world and into herself simultaneously. This is not naive optimism. This is the specific, earned, hard-won hope of someone who has been through something and come out the other side and found that the stars are, in fact, still there. They were always still there. You are allowed to wish on them. The universe is listening, even when it is quiet.',
    reversed: 'The stars are there. You just cannot see them right now, possibly because you are inside, definitely because something has dimmed the view. The reversed Star is not hopelessness — it is hope temporarily interrupted by an understandable and proportionate amount of despair about something that was genuinely hard. The prescription is not to feel better immediately. The prescription is to open a window. Or, metaphorically, to open a window.'
  },

  'The Moon': {
    upright: 'The Moon illuminates a path between two towers, and on that path is a crawfish emerging from the water, a dog, and a wolf — all of them apparently confused, which is the correct response to navigating by moonlight. This is the card of the beautiful, treacherous, deeply unreliable unconscious. Everything looks slightly different by moonlight than it actually is. The dog and the wolf are both howling at the same thing, which may tell you something about the gap between civilized anxiety and primal anxiety. They are the same anxiety. Walk the path slowly.',
    reversed: 'The moon is waning and some of the fog is lifting, which brings equal parts relief and the mild embarrassment of seeing clearly what you were convinced about in the dark. The reversed Moon suggests that an illusion is dissolving — possibly one you constructed yourself for reasons that seemed excellent at the time. As the light returns: be kind to yourself about what you believed when you could not see properly. Everyone navigates by moonlight sometimes.'
  },

  'The Sun': {
    upright: 'A child rides a white horse under a giant sun holding a red flag, looking absolutely delighted about all of it, which is either aspirational or annoying depending on your current relationship with joy. The Sun is the most straightforwardly good card in the deck and it has arrived to tell you that you are allowed to be happy now. Not later. Now. Not after you have addressed the seventeen outstanding items on the worry list. The Sun has reviewed the list and found it uncompelling. Joy is the assignment.',
    reversed: 'The sun is there but you are not feeling it, which happens and which the Sun does not take personally. Perhaps the expectations are too high, the comparison too active, the joy being performed for an audience rather than actually inhabited. The reversed Sun is not depression — it is the specific flavor of feeling like you should be happier than you are, which is its own particular sadness. Lower the bar. Find one genuinely good thing. Start there.'
  },

  'Judgement': {
    upright: 'Angels are sounding trumpets, the dead are rising from their coffins, and everyone is experiencing a significant existential reckoning — and the remarkable thing is that the overall energy in the card is positive. This is the call to rise into who you actually are, which requires leaving behind who you told yourself you were. The past version of you served its purpose. The current version of you is the point. Answer the trumpet. It has your name on it.',
    reversed: 'The trumpet has been sounding for some time now and you have been hitting snooze on a scale that would impress even the most dedicated avoider of things. The reversed Judgement is the call unheeded, the invitation declined, the opportunity to reinvent yourself met with the response "I\'ll think about it." You will. You have been thinking about it. At some point, thinking about it and doing it are different activities. This card strongly suggests the second activity.'
  },

  'The World': {
    upright: 'The dancer at the center of The World is wreathed in a laurel wreath, surrounded by the four living creatures representing everything, and is dancing. This is the correct response to completing something significant. You have finished. Actually finished. This does not happen as often as it should because most things trail off or get replaced by new things — but this one is done. There is a moment here to genuinely register that. Take it. The next spiral begins soon enough. Dance first.',
    reversed: 'So close. The finish line is right there and something has intervened — a last missing piece, a loose thread, a lesson that turned out to have one more chapter. The reversed World is not failure; it is the card of the almost. What remains? It is usually smaller and more specific than it feels. Find it. The completion is real; it is simply waiting for you to attend to the one thing still pending. After that: dancing.'
